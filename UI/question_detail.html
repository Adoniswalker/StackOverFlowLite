            <h3>How can I delete a pre-installed language in Ubuntu 18.04?</h3>
            <p>
                screenshot of Language Support

                I have reinstalled my computer system with the Ubuntu 18.04 last night, and while I install the system I
                chose the system language is English but there is Chinese language package installed without my
                agreement
                now. (What happened exactly?)

                I try to remove this language in the Install/Remove Languages... button, but when I open the language
                setting, the system warns me there is some recommended package not installed and want to install it for
                me.
                (I do not need it at all.)

                So, is there any ways to remove this language showing in the screenshot?</p>

                Thanks for Mr.Hjalmarsson's help.

                Follow this Steps:

                First, make sure that language which you want to make it disappear in this page is not set as the
                "regional
                formats" setting.

                Then check the folder which in /usr/share/locale-langpack and using command ls like this:


            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                We can see there has a language folder which you want to remove like zh, this zh folder was created by
                the
                installer since you (apparently) selected a Chinese time zone location, so we removed it now.

                sudo rmdir /usr/share/locale-langpack/zh
                At last, we use the command gnome-language-selector to remove the Chinese language packages again and
                re-open the gnome-language-selector, the "汉语(中国)" will never appear.

                If you can't see the "汉语(中国)", we should do some clean work after remove, so, just remove all of the
                folders
                which have the characters zh in the folders name.
